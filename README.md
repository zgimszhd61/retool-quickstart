## Retool Quickstart

Retool is a powerful low-code platform that allows you to quickly build internal tools and applications by connecting to various data sources and APIs. Here's a quickstart guide to help you get started with building your first Retool app:

### 1. Sign Up and Create a New App

- Go to the Retool website (https://retool.com) and sign up for a free account.
- After signing in, click on "Create new" and select "Web app" to create a new web application.

### 2. Connect a Data Source

Retool can connect to a wide range of data sources, including databases, APIs, and cloud services. For this quickstart, we'll use the built-in Retool Database:

- Click on the "Resources" tab and select "Retool Database."
- Click "Create table" and name it "products."
- Add columns for `id` (integer), `name` (text), `quantity` (integer), and `price` (integer).
- Click "Create table" and optionally import sample data from a CSV file.

### 3. Create a Query

Queries in Retool allow you to interact with your data sources:

- Click on the "Queries" tab and select "New query."
- Name the query "getProducts" and select the "products" table from the resource dropdown.
- Write a SQL query to retrieve data from the table, e.g., `SELECT * FROM products;`
- Click "Save & run" to execute the query and fetch the data.

### 4. Add UI Components

Retool provides a wide range of UI components that you can drag and drop onto the canvas:

- From the components panel, drag a "Table" component onto the canvas.
- In the properties panel, set the "Data" property to `{{ queries.getProducts.data }}` to display the data from your query.
- Customize the table columns by mapping the desired fields from the data source.

### 5. Add Interactivity

You can add interactivity to your app by connecting components and using JavaScript expressions:

- Drag a "Button" component onto the canvas.
- Set the "onClick" property to a JavaScript expression that performs an action, e.g., `{{ queries.createProduct.run({ name: 'New Product', quantity: 10, price: 99 }) }}` to create a new product.
- Refresh the table by re-running the `getProducts` query after the action is completed.

### 6. Deploy and Share

Once you've built your app, you can deploy it and share it with others:

- Click on the "Share" button in the top-right corner.
- Select "Deploy" to create a shareable URL for your app.
- Share the URL with others, or embed the app in your existing web applications or portals.

This quickstart covers the basic steps to get you started with Retool. You can explore more advanced features, such as authentication, custom components, and integrations, in the Retool documentation[1][2][4][5].
